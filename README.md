I am a PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Cognitive Psychology with a minor in Quantitative Methodology. My research specialization is in learning, reasoning, problem solving and motivation.

I'm actively looking for work related to data science, UX research, policy/public opinion research, and educational technologies.
