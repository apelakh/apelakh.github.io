::: {#hero-heading}
I am currently completing a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh's [Learning Research and Development Center](https://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/people/researcher-detail.cshtml?id=2115) with a minor in [Quantitative Methodology](https://www.psychology.pitt.edu/graduate/additional-training-options/minor-quantitative-methodology). My research interests are focused on reasoning, problem solving, and motivation in the context of STEM learning.

I have a passion for working with data and possess strong skills in statistical analysis, data visualization, and survey programming and design. I also have experience with qualitative and mixed methods research.

In addition to my experience with research and analysis, I have a background in media production and graphic design which makes me especially well suited for creating effective science communication.
